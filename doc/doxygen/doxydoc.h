/*
 * This is the top level Doxygen documentation file for this project. Use this

 * documentation.

// The front page of your documentation goes here. Provide a description of your
// software here. You may also want to include a brief user's guide, instructions
// to compile and run the software, etc. Use \section and \subsection to organise 
// into sections.

// Define top level groupings for your source code documentation here. These
// will be listed in the 'Modules' section. 
// - use \defgroup to define a group. 
// - use \ingroup <name> in your source code to tell Doxygen you want that bit of
//   code documented in group <name>. Note that groups can be nested.
// - use \addtogroup anywhere in source code to define a new group if it doesn't
//   already exist.
// See http://www.doxygen.nl/grouping.html for more on grouping.
